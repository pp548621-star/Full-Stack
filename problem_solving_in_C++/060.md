## 60.Write a program that takes an integer (1-7) as input and prints the corresponding day of the week (1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, ..., 7 for Saturday) using a switch statement.
Example:

Input: 3

Output: Tuesday

---

### **Brute-Force Approach (Using `if-else`)**

```cpp
#include <iostream> // Include library for input/output operations
using namespace std; // Use standard namespace to simplify code

// Function to print the corresponding day of the week using if-else (Brute-Force Approach)
void printDayBruteForce(int day) {
    // Check each possible value for the input
    if (day == 1) { // If input is 1
        cout << "Sunday" << endl; // Print "Sunday"
    } else if (day == 2) { // If input is 2
        cout << "Monday" << endl; // Print "Monday"
    } else if (day == 3) { // If input is 3
        cout << "Tuesday" << endl; // Print "Tuesday"
    } else if (day == 4) { // If input is 4
        cout << "Wednesday" << endl; // Print "Wednesday"
    } else if (day == 5) { // If input is 5
        cout << "Thursday" << endl; // Print "Thursday"
    } else if (day == 6) { // If input is 6
        cout << "Friday" << endl; // Print "Friday"
    } else if (day == 7) { // If input is 7
        cout << "Saturday" << endl; // Print "Saturday"
    } else { // For any other input
        cout << "Error: Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 7." << endl;
        // Print an error message for invalid input
    }
}

// Main function for Brute-Force approach
int main() {
    int day; // Declare a variable to store the user input for the day number

    // Prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 7
    cout << "Enter a number (1-7) to get the corresponding day of the week: ";
    cin >> day; // Take user input and store it in the variable 'day'

    // Call the Brute-Force function
    printDayBruteForce(day);

    return 0; // Indicate successful program termination
}

### Time Complexity:
Best Case: If day == 1, the condition if (day == 1) will be true, and the program will immediately output 
"Sunday". This is constant time.

O(1): In the best case, the program directly matches the first condition.

Worst Case: If day == 7, the program will check all 7 conditions before finding the match.

Therefore, the worst-case scenario still results in constant time since the number of checks is fixed and does not grow with input size.

O(1): The maximum number of comparisons is fixed, so time complexity is still constant.

Overall Time Complexity: O(1)

### Space Complexity:
The program only uses one integer variable (day) for input, and no additional data structures are used. 
The space usage is constant.

O(1): The space required does not depend on input size.

Overall Space Complexity: O(1)

### **Easy Approach (Using `switch` Statement)**

```cpp
#include <iostream> // Include library for input/output operations
using namespace std; // Use standard namespace to simplify code

// Function to print the corresponding day of the week using switch statement (Easy Approach)
void printDaySwitch(int day) {
    switch (day) { // Start a switch-case block to map input to corresponding days
        case 1: // If the input is 1
            cout << "Sunday" << endl; // Output "Sunday"
            break; // Exit the switch block
        case 2: // If the input is 2
            cout << "Monday" << endl; // Output "Monday"
            break; // Exit the switch block
        case 3: // If the input is 3
            cout << "Tuesday" << endl; // Output "Tuesday"
            break; // Exit the switch block
        case 4: // If the input is 4
            cout << "Wednesday" << endl; // Output "Wednesday"
            break; // Exit the switch block
        case 5: // If the input is 5
            cout << "Thursday" << endl; // Output "Thursday"
            break; // Exit the switch block
        case 6: // If the input is 6
            cout << "Friday" << endl; // Output "Friday"
            break; // Exit the switch block
        case 7: // If the input is 7
            cout << "Saturday" << endl; // Output "Saturday"
            break; // Exit the switch block
        default: // If the input is not between 1 and 7
            cout << "Error: Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 7." << endl;
            // Output an error message for invalid input
    }
}

// Main function for Easy approach (Switch statement)
int main() {
    int day; // Declare a variable to store the user input for the day number

    // Prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 7
    cout << "Enter a number (1-7) to get the corresponding day of the week: ";
    cin >> day; // Take user input and store it in the variable 'day'

    // Call the Easy approach (Switch) function
    printDaySwitch(day);

    return 0; // Indicate successful program termination
}
```
### Time Complexity:
Best Case: The program jumps directly to the matching case and outputs the corresponding day. This is an efficient lookup.

O(1): The lookup and print operation is performed in constant time.

Worst Case: Even in the worst case (when day == 7), the program will jump to the correct case and print the day, which takes constant time.

O(1): The time complexity remains constant because there is a fixed number of cases to evaluate.

Overall Time Complexity: O(1)

### Space Complexity:
Similar to the brute-force approach, the program uses only one variable (day) and no additional storage or data structures.

O(1): The space usage is constant.

Overall Space Complexity: O(1)

### **Moderate Approach (Using an Array)**

```cpp
#include <iostream> // Include library for input/output operations
using namespace std; // Use standard namespace to simplify code

// Function to print the corresponding day of the week using an array (Moderate Approach)
void printDayArray(int day) {
    // Array of days where index 1 maps to Sunday, 2 to Monday, etc.
    string days[] = {"Invalid", "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", 
                     "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"};
    
    // Check if the input is valid (between 1 and 7)
    if (day >= 1 && day <= 7) {
        cout << days[day] << endl; // Output the corresponding day
    } else {
        cout << "Error: Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 7." << endl;
        // Output an error message for invalid input
    }
}

// Main function for Moderate approach (Array)
int main() {
    int day; // Declare a variable to store the user input for the day number

    // Prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 7
    cout << "Enter a number (1-7) to get the corresponding day of the week: ";
    cin >> day; // Take user input and store it in the variable 'day'

    // Call the Moderate approach (Array) function
    printDayArray(day);

    return 0; // Indicate successful program termination
}
```
### Time Complexity:
Best Case: If day == 3, the program directly accesses days[3], which is a constant-time array lookup.

O(1): The access to the array element is a constant-time operation.

Worst Case: The program checks if the day is valid (between 1 and 7), and then performs an array lookup.

 This is still a constant-time operation because the size of the array is fixed.

O(1): The time complexity remains constant as the array size is fixed.

Overall Time Complexity: O(1)

### Space Complexity:
The program creates a static array days[] with a size of 8 elements (1 for invalid, 7 for the days of the week). 

This space is constant and independent of input size.

O(1): The space complexity is constant because the array size is fixed.

Overall Space Complexity: O(1)

### **Optimal Approach (Using a Hash Map)**

```cpp
#include <iostream> // Include library for input/output operations
#include <unordered_map> // Include unordered_map library for hash map implementation
using namespace std; // Use standard namespace to simplify code

// Function to print the corresponding day of the week using a hash map (Optimal Approach)
void printDayMap(int day) {
    // Create a hash map (unordered_map) that maps integers to day names
    unordered_map<int, string> days = {
        {1, "Sunday"}, {2, "Monday"}, {3, "Tuesday"},
        {4, "Wednesday"}, {5, "Thursday"}, {6, "Friday"}, {7, "Saturday"}
    };

    // Check if the day exists in the map
    if (days.find(day) != days.end()) {
        cout << days[day] << endl; // Output the corresponding day
    } else {
        cout << "Error: Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 7." << endl;
        // Output an error message for invalid input
    }
}

// Main function for Optimal approach (Hash map)
int main() {
    int day; // Declare a variable to store the user input for the day number

    // Prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 7
    cout << "Enter a number (1-7) to get the corresponding day of the week: ";
    cin >> day; // Take user input and store it in the variable 'day'

    // Call the Optimal approach (Hash map) function
    printDayMap(day);

    return 0; // Indicate successful program termination
}
```
### Time Complexity:
Best Case: The program performs a lookup on the hash map. 

Since hash maps provide average constant-time lookup, this operation is O(1).

Worst Case: In the worst case, the hash map lookup is still constant time, assuming no significant hash collisions. 
Hence, even in the worst case, the lookup operation takes O(1).

O(1): Hash maps generally offer O(1) time complexity for lookups.
Overall Time Complexity: O(1)

### Space Complexity:
The program creates an unordered map (unordered_map<int, string> days) with 7 entries. 

The space used by the hash map is constant because it only stores a fixed number of days (7 entries).

O(1): The space required is fixed and does not depend on the size of the input.

Overall Space Complexity: O(1)

### **Summary of Time and Space Complexity for Each Approach**:

| **Approach**                    | **Time Complexity** | **Space Complexity** |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Brute-Force (if-else)**        | **O(1)**            | **O(1)**             |
| **Easy (switch statement)**      | **O(1)**            | **O(1)**             |
| **Moderate (Array)**             | **O(1)**            | **O(1)**             |
| **Optimal (Hash Map)**           | **O(1)**            | **O(1)**             |

### **Conclusion**:
- All approaches are very efficient with **constant time complexity** and **constant space complexity** because they deal with a fixed input size (the days of the week). 
- **Brute-Force** and **Switch** are very straightforward but have slightly less readability and scalability.
- The **Array** and **Hash Map** approaches are more scalable and flexible for larger applications, though the performance difference for this problem is negligible. The hash map is ideal for cases where you need fast lookups for larger sets of data.
