# Data Types in C++

Data types are the fundamental building blocks in any programming language, dictating what kind of data a variable can hold and how much space it occupies in memory. In C++, data types are divided mainly into **Primitive (Fundamental) Data Types** and **Non-Primitive (Derived and User-Defined) Data Types**. Understanding these in depth is crucial to mastering memory management, variable manipulation, and writing efficient code in C++. This comprehensive guide explores both categories, their characteristics, modifiers, memory requirements, and usage with rich examples.

## Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types, also called fundamental data types, are directly supported by the C++ compiler and generally map to specific fixed-size memory representations of data. They represent the simplest form of data: integers, characters, decimals, and logical values.

### Characteristics of Primitive Data Types

- Hold single values.
- Directly map to hardware-level memory.
- Sized according to system architecture and compiler, but standardized sizes often apply.
- Fast access and operations supported by CPU.


### Common Primitive Data Types in C++

| Data Type | Description | Typical Size (Bytes) | Range / Representation | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `bool` | Boolean value: true (1) or false (0) | 1 | Represents logical states | `bool isReady = true;` |
| `char` | Single character (ASCII or extended) | 1 | Stores single characters (signed or unsigned) | `char letter = 'A';` |
| `wchar_t` | Wide character for Unicode support | 2 or 4 | Wide characters, supports larger character sets | `wchar_t wc = L'Ω';` |
| `char16_t` | 16-bit character type for UTF-16 | 2 | Unicode characters (UTF-16) | `char16_t u16 = u'x';` |
| `char32_t` | 32-bit character type for UTF-32 | 4 | Unicode characters (UTF-32) | `char32_t u32 = U'y';` |
| `short` | Small integer | 2 | -32,768 to 32,767 | `short s = 10000;` |
| `int` | Typical integer | 4 | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 | `int age = 30;` |
| `long` | Large integer | 4 or 8 | Larger integer range depending on platform | `long population = 7000000;` |
| `long long` | Very large integer | 8 | Signed 64-bit integers | `long long distance = 1234567890;` |
| `float` | Single precision floating-point | 4 | Approximate ±1.2e-38 to ±3.4e38, ~6 decimal digits | `float pi = 3.14159f;` |
| `double` | Double precision floating-point | 8 | Approximate ±2.3e-308 to ±1.7e308, ~15 decimal digits | `double e = 2.718281828;` |
| `long double` | Extended precision floating-point | 12, 16 or more | Higher precision floats depending on implementation | `long double ld = 3.141592653589793;` |
| `void` | Represents "no type" or empty type | 0 | Used for functions returning nothing | `void func();` |

### Detailed Insights on Primitive Types

#### Boolean (`bool`)

The `bool` type stores truth values — `true` or `false`. In C++, `true` is internally represented as integer `1` and `false` as `0`. This type is essential for conditional branching, loops, and logical operations.

```cpp
bool isEven(int n) {
    return (n % 2 == 0);
}

int main() {
    bool result = isEven(10);
    if(result)
        std::cout << "Even number" << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "Odd number" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```


#### Character (`char`)

`char` typically holds a single ASCII character. It consumes one byte of memory and can be signed or unsigned depending on the compiler.

```cpp
char letter = 'Z';
std::cout << "The letter is: " << letter << std::endl;
```

**Behind the scenes:** Each `char` corresponds to an integer value representing an ASCII code. `'A'` is 65, `'Z'` is 90, etc.

#### Wide Character (`wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`)

To handle international character sets like Unicode, C++ introduces wide characters:

- `wchar_t` typically holds 2 or 4 bytes.
- `char16_t` is for UTF-16 encoding (16 bits).
- `char32_t` is for UTF-32 encoding (32 bits).

They allow programs to process multiple languages and special symbols.

#### Integer Types

Vital to store integral numeric values.

- `short` is a smaller integer, usually 2 bytes.
- `int` is the standard integer type on most systems (4 bytes).
- `long` and `long long` provide wider ranges (usually 4 or 8 bytes, depending on architecture).

Modifiers like `signed` and `unsigned` affect whether the variable holds only positive numbers or both positive and negative.

```cpp
unsigned int positiveCount = 100;
signed int temperature = -30;
```


#### Floating-Point Types: `float`, `double`, and `long double`

Floating-point types store decimal numbers but approximate them due to binary representation.

- `float`: Single precision, 4 bytes, suitable for saving memory but less precise.
- `double`: Double precision, 8 bytes, good precision for scientific calculations.
- `long double`: Extended precision (platform-dependent), suitable for high-precision tasks.

```cpp
float pi = 3.14159f;
double g = 9.80665;
```

### Modifiers for Integer Types

C++ allows modifiers to fine-tune the size and sign of integral types:


| Modifier | Example | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `signed` | `signed int x;` | Can represent negative and positive values (default) |
| `unsigned` | `unsigned int y;` | Only positive, doubles positive range |
| `short` | `short int s;` | Typically 2 bytes, smaller range |
| `long` | `long int l;` | Larger storage, 4/8 bytes |
| `long long` | `long long int ll;` | Very large storage, typically 8 bytes |

Example:

```cpp
unsigned short us = 65535;   // Max for unsigned short
signed short ss = -32768;    // Min for signed short
```

## Non-Primitive Data Types

Non-primitive data types extend primitive types to model complex data and support efficient handling of collections or user-defined objects. They include derived types such as arrays and pointers, and user-defined types such as structs, classes, and unions.

***

### Derived Data Types

Derived types are created from primitive types by combining or referencing them.

#### 1. Arrays

Arrays are collections of elements having the same type, stored contiguously in memory. They provide efficient indexed access but have a fixed size.

```cpp
int numbers[^5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
std::cout << "Third number: " << numbers[^1] << std::endl; // Outputs 30
```

- Arrays can be **single-dimensional** or **multi-dimensional**.
- The compiler lays out arrays in contiguous memory, facilitating fast access.


#### 2. Pointers

Pointers store the memory address of variables.

```cpp
int x = 10;
int* p = &x;
std::cout << "Value of x: " << *p << std::endl;   // Dereference pointer
```

Use pointers for dynamic memory allocation, efficient array handling, and complex data structures like linked lists and trees.

***

### User-Defined Data Types

Created by programmers to model complex entities.

#### 1. Structs (`struct`)

Structs group related variables together into a single unit but have all members `public` by default.

```cpp
struct Person {
    std::string name;
    int age;
};

Person p = {"Alice", 30};
std::cout << p.name << " is " << p.age << " years old." << std::endl;
```


#### 2. Classes (`class`)

Classes encapsulate data (attributes) and functions (methods). Members are `private` by default, supporting **encapsulation**.

```cpp
class Car {
private:
    std::string brand;
    int year;
public:
    Car(std::string b, int y) : brand(b), year(y) {}
    void display() {
        std::cout << brand << " " << year << std::endl;
    }
};

Car myCar("Tesla", 2021);
myCar.display();
```

- Classes form the basis for **object-oriented programming (OOP)**.


#### 3. Unions (`union`)

Unions allow different data types to share the same memory location, useful for memory-critical applications.

```cpp
union Value {
    int i;
    float f;
    char c;
};

Value val;
val.i = 10;
std::cout << val.i << std::endl;
val.f = 3.14f;
std::cout << val.f << std::endl;
// Note: After assigning to f, i's value is undefined due to shared memory.
```


***

### Enumerations (`enum`)

Enumerations define a set of named integral constants, improving code readability.

```cpp
enum Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE };

Color favorite = GREEN;
if (favorite == GREEN) {
    std::cout << "You like green!" << std::endl;
}
```

## Memory Layout and Data Types

Understanding how data types translate to memory helps write efficient programs.


| Data Type | Typical Memory Layout |
| :-- | :-- |
| `char` | 1 byte — stores ASCII code |
| `int` | 4 bytes — stores 32-bit signed integer |
| `float` | 4 bytes — IEEE 754 floating-point |
| `double` | 8 bytes — IEEE 754 double precision |
| Arrays | Contiguous sequence of elements |
| Pointers | Store memory address (typically 4 or 8 bytes) |
| Struct / Class | Sequentially packed data members with possible padding |
| Union | Single memory block shared by all members |

| `float` | 4 | Single precision floating point | ~1.2e–38 | ~3.4e+38 |
| `double` | 8 | Double precision floating point | ~2.3e–308 | ~1.7e+308 |
| `long double` | 12 or 16 | Extended precision floating point | Varies | Varies |

## Final Notes on Data Types

- C++ is a **strongly typed** language; variables must be declared with proper data types.
- Choosing the right data type affects:
    - **Memory usage:** Smaller types save memory but may limit range and precision.
    - **Performance:** Operations on primitive types are usually faster.
    - **Correctness:** Storing a value in an inappropriate type can cause overflow, loss of data, or undefined behavior.
- Use **modifiers** (signed, unsigned, long, short) to tweak data types for specific applications.
- Non-primitive types empower you to create powerful abstractions and model real-world entities.
