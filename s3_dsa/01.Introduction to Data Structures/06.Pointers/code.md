Introduction and Representation
-------------------------------
  - In C++, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
  - Pointers allow direct access and manipulation of memory locations.
  - Syntax to declare a pointer:
      datatype *pointerName;
    Example: int *ptr;

Example Code:
  int x = 10;
  int *ptr = &x;   // ptr stores address of x

Value of x: 10
Address of x (&x): 0x7ffeefbff58c
Value stored in ptr (address of x): 0x7ffeefbff58c
Value pointed to by ptr (*ptr): 10

Pointer Arithmetic and Representation:
  - Pointer stores a memory address.
  - You can use the dereference operator (*) to access or modify the value at that address.
  - Example: *ptr = 20; updates the value of x to 20 via pointer.

After *ptr = 20; value of x is now: 20
```
