# ORDER BY (Sorting Data)

## 1. Introduction

* By default, SQL does **not guarantee order** of rows in query results.
* The **ORDER BY** clause is used to **sort query results**.
* Sorting can be:

  * **Ascending (ASC)** â†’ smallest to largest (default).
  * **Descending (DESC)** â†’ largest to smallest.

ðŸ‘‰ In CodingGita Portal:

* Students can view their marks sorted from **highest to lowest**.
* Admin can list students **alphabetically by name**.
* Faculty can order students **by semester, then marks**.

## 2. Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC];
```

---

## 3. Examples

### 3.1 Sort Students by Name (Ascending)

```sql
SELECT RollNo, Name, City 
FROM Student
ORDER BY Name ASC;
```

**Output**

| RollNo | Name   | City      |
| ------ | ------ | --------- |
| 103    | Arjun  | Vadodara  |
| 101    | Jenil  | Ahmedabad |
| 102    | Mahir  | Surat     |
| 104    | Yashvi | Rajkot    |

---

### 3.2 Sort Students by City (Descending)

```sql
SELECT RollNo, Name, City 
FROM Student
ORDER BY City DESC;
```

**Output**

| RollNo | Name   | City      |
| ------ | ------ | --------- |
| 103    | Arjun  | Vadodara  |
| 104    | Yashvi | Rajkot    |
| 102    | Mahir  | Surat     |
| 101    | Jenil  | Ahmedabad |

### 3.3 Sort Students by Semester, Then Name

```sql
SELECT RollNo, Name, Semester, City
FROM Student
ORDER BY Semester ASC, Name ASC;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Sorts first by Semester, then alphabetically by Name.

---

### 3.4 Sort Enrollment by Marks (Highest First)

```sql
SELECT E.RollNo, S.Name, E.CourseID, E.Marks
FROM Enrollment E
JOIN Student S ON E.RollNo = S.RollNo
ORDER BY E.Marks DESC;
```

**Output**

| RollNo | Name   | CourseID | Marks |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | ----- |
| 103    | Arjun  | CS101    | 95    |
| 101    | Jenil  | CS101    | 92    |
| 104    | Yashvi | CS103    | 85    |
| 102    | Mahir  | CS102    | 76    |

### 3.5 Sorting with Aliases

```sql
SELECT Name, (Marks + 5) AS BonusMarks
FROM Enrollment E
JOIN Student S ON E.RollNo = S.RollNo
ORDER BY BonusMarks DESC;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Sorts results using calculated column alias `BonusMarks`.

---

### 3.6 Sorting with Expressions

```sql
SELECT Name, Marks
FROM Enrollment E
JOIN Student S ON E.RollNo = S.RollNo
ORDER BY (Marks % 10) ASC;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Orders students by **last digit of Marks**.

## 4. Summary

* **ORDER BY** â†’ Sorts results by one or more columns.
* Default order = **ASC (ascending)**.
* Use **DESC** for descending order.
* Supports sorting on:

  * Multiple columns.
  * Aliases (calculated fields).
  * Expressions (Marks % 10).
* Essential for presenting results in **readable order**.
