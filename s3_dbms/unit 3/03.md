# DML (Data Manipulation Language)

## 1. What is DML?

* **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** is used to **add, modify, and remove data** inside tables.
* Unlike DDL (which changes structure), DML deals with the **actual records (rows)**.
* DML commands can be **rolled back** if not committed.

ðŸ‘‰ In CodingGita portal:

* Inserting new student details.
* Updating a studentâ€™s marks or city.
* Deleting outdated course records.

## 2. INSERT Command

Used to **add new rows** into a table.

### Syntax

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) 
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

### Example 1 â€“ Insert Student

```sql
INSERT INTO Student (RollNo, Name, Semester, City)
VALUES (105, 'Priyesha', 3, 'Baroda');
```

### Example 2 â€“ Insert Multiple Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO Student VALUES
(106, 'Krishna', 3, 'Ahmedabad'),
(107, 'Raj', 2, 'Surat');
```

### Example 3 â€“ Insert Using SELECT

```sql
INSERT INTO StudentBackup (RollNo, Name, City)
SELECT RollNo, Name, City FROM Student WHERE Semester = 3;
```

---

## 3. UPDATE Command

Used to **modify existing rows**.

### Syntax

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE condition;
```

### Example 1 â€“ Update Student City

```sql
UPDATE Student
SET City = 'Surat'
WHERE RollNo = 105;
```

### Example 2 â€“ Update Marks

```sql
UPDATE Enrollment
SET Marks = 95
WHERE RollNo = 101 AND CourseID = 'CS101';
```

### Example 3 â€“ Update Multiple Columns

```sql
UPDATE Student
SET Name = 'Mahir Shah', City = 'Ahmedabad'
WHERE RollNo = 102;
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Important:** Always use **WHERE** with UPDATE. Without it, all rows will be updated.

---

## 4. DELETE Command

Used to **remove rows** from a table.

### Syntax

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

### Example 1 â€“ Delete One Student

```sql
DELETE FROM Student WHERE RollNo = 107;
```

### Example 2 â€“ Delete Students from Surat

```sql
DELETE FROM Student WHERE City = 'Surat';
```

### Example 3 â€“ Delete All Rows (Careful!)

```sql
DELETE FROM Student;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Difference between **DELETE vs TRUNCATE**:

* DELETE removes row by row, can use conditions, can be rolled back.
* TRUNCATE removes all rows instantly, cannot use conditions, usually cannot be rolled back.

## 5. Example Database Before & After DML

### Student Table (Before)

| RollNo | Name     | Semester | City      |
| ------ | -------- | -------- | --------- |
| 101    | Jenil    | 3        | Ahmedabad |
| 102    | Mahir    | 3        | Surat     |
| 103    | Arjun    | 3        | Vadodara  |
| 104    | Yashvi   | 3        | Rajkot    |
| 105    | Priyesha | 3        | Baroda    |

### After Update (Priyesha City â†’ Surat)

| RollNo | Name     | Semester | City  |
| ------ | -------- | -------- | ----- |
| 105    | Priyesha | 3        | Surat |

### After Delete (Remove RollNo 105)

| RollNo | Name   | Semester | City      |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | --------- |
| 101    | Jenil  | 3        | Ahmedabad |
| 102    | Mahir  | 3        | Surat     |
| 103    | Arjun  | 3        | Vadodara  |
| 104    | Yashvi | 3        | Rajkot    |

## 6. Common Mistakes in DML

* Forgetting **WHERE clause** â†’ accidentally updates/deletes all rows.
* Inserting wrong datatype (e.g., text into INT column).
* Violating constraints (e.g., duplicate RollNo when PRIMARY KEY exists).

---

## 7. Practice Exercises

1. Insert 3 new students into Student table.
2. Update Semester = 4 for student RollNo = 103.
3. Update all students from Ahmedabad to Semester = 5.
4. Delete a student with RollNo = 104.
5. Delete all students in Semester 2.

---

## 8. Summary

* **INSERT** â†’ Add new rows.
* **UPDATE** â†’ Modify existing rows (always use WHERE).
* **DELETE** â†’ Remove rows (can be rolled back).
* DML modifies data, not structure (unlike DDL).
* CodingGita examples (Studentâ€“Courseâ€“Faculty DB) showed practical usage.
