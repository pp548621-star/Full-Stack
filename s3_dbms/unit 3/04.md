# DQL (SELECT & Filtering)

## 1. Introduction to DQL

* **DQL (Data Query Language)** is used to **retrieve/query data** from databases.
* In SQL, **only one command belongs to DQL** â†’ `SELECT`.
* Even though it looks simple, `SELECT` is the **most powerful and frequently used SQL command**.

ðŸ‘‰ In CodingGita portal:

* Students check their results (`SELECT Marks`).
* Faculty checks enrolled students in their courses.
* Admin queries list of all students by city/semester.

## 2. Basic SELECT Statement

### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

### Example 1 â€“ Select All Columns

```sql
SELECT * FROM Student;
```

**Output (Student Table)**

| RollNo | Name   | Semester | City      |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | --------- |
| 101    | Jenil  | 3        | Ahmedabad |
| 102    | Mahir  | 3        | Surat     |
| 103    | Arjun  | 3        | Vadodara  |
| 104    | Yashvi | 3        | Rajkot    |

---

### Example 2 â€“ Select Specific Columns

```sql
SELECT Name, City FROM Student;
```

**Output**

| Name   | City      |
| ------ | --------- |
| Jenil  | Ahmedabad |
| Mahir  | Surat     |
| Arjun  | Vadodara  |
| Yashvi | Rajkot    |

---

## 3. Aliasing Columns (Renaming in Output)

We can rename columns for clarity using `AS`.

```sql
SELECT Name AS StudentName, City AS Hometown FROM Student;
```

**Output**

| StudentName | Hometown  |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Jenil       | Ahmedabad |
| Mahir       | Surat     |
| Arjun       | Vadodara  |
| Yashvi      | Rajkot    |

## 4. Filtering with WHERE Clause

The `WHERE` clause filters rows based on conditions.

### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

---

### 4.1 Comparison Operators

* `=` â†’ equal
* `>` â†’ greater than
* `<` â†’ less than
* `>=` â†’ greater or equal
* `<=` â†’ less or equal
* `!=` or `<>` â†’ not equal

#### Example 1 â€“ Students from Ahmedabad

```sql
SELECT Name, City FROM Student WHERE City = 'Ahmedabad';
```

**Output**

| Name  | City      |
| ----- | --------- |
| Jenil | Ahmedabad |

#### Example 2 â€“ Students in Semester 3

```sql
SELECT Name, Semester FROM Student WHERE Semester = 3;
```

---

### 4.2 Logical Operators

* `AND` â†’ both conditions must be true.
* `OR` â†’ at least one condition true.
* `NOT` â†’ negates condition.

#### Example 3 â€“ Students in Semester 3 AND from Surat

```sql
SELECT Name, Semester, City 
FROM Student 
WHERE Semester = 3 AND City = 'Surat';
```

**Output**

| Name  | Semester | City  |
| ----- | -------- | ----- |
| Mahir | 3        | Surat |

#### Example 4 â€“ Students from Surat OR Rajkot

```sql
SELECT Name, City 
FROM Student 
WHERE City = 'Surat' OR City = 'Rajkot';
```

---

### 4.3 IN Operator

* Used to check if a value exists in a list.

```sql
SELECT Name, City FROM Student 
WHERE City IN ('Surat', 'Ahmedabad');
```

---

### 4.4 BETWEEN Operator

* Used for range queries.

```sql
SELECT Name, Semester FROM Student 
WHERE Semester BETWEEN 2 AND 4;
```

---

### 4.5 LIKE Operator (Pattern Matching)

* `%` â†’ matches any sequence of characters.
* `_` â†’ matches a single character.

#### Example 1 â€“ Names starting with â€˜Aâ€™

```sql
SELECT Name FROM Student WHERE Name LIKE 'A%';
```

Result: Arjun

#### Example 2 â€“ Names with exactly 5 characters

```sql
SELECT Name FROM Student WHERE Name LIKE '_____';
```

---

## 5. DISTINCT â€“ Removing Duplicates

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT City FROM Student;
```

**Output**

| City      |
| --------- |
| Ahmedabad |
| Surat     |
| Vadodara  |
| Rajkot    |

ðŸ‘‰ If 2 students were from Surat, it would still appear **once**.

---

## 6. LIMIT / TOP â€“ Restricting Rows

### MySQL / PostgreSQL

```sql
SELECT * FROM Student LIMIT 2;
```

### SQL Server

```sql
SELECT TOP 2 * FROM Student;
```

---

## 7. Combining Conditions

We can use **complex filters** with multiple operators.

```sql
SELECT Name, City, Semester 
FROM Student
WHERE Semester = 3 AND City NOT IN ('Ahmedabad');
```

---

## 8. Summary

* **SELECT** â†’ fetch data from tables.
* Can fetch all (`*`) or specific columns.
* **WHERE clause** allows filtering using comparison, logical, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE.
* **DISTINCT** removes duplicates.
* **LIMIT/TOP** restricts result size.
* Practical queries with **Studentâ€“Course DB** demonstrated common use cases.
