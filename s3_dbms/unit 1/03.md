# View of Data (3-Level Architecture)

## 1. Introduction

A **Database System** must support different kinds of users:

* Students (who see their marks only)
* Teachers (who see marks of their subjects)
* Admin (who sees everything: fees, courses, attendance)

But all this information is stored in the **same central database**.
How does DBMS make sure that **different users see different views** of the same data?

The answer is through the **3-level architecture of data abstraction**, also called the **View of Data**.

## 2. What is ‚ÄúView of Data‚Äù?

The **View of Data** is the way in which a **user perceives the data** stored in the system.

* A student does not need to know **how data is stored in memory**.
* A DBA cares about **storage techniques, indexes, and files**.
* A teacher only needs to see **students‚Äô marks**.

üëâ Different levels of views are necessary to **simplify access, improve security, and provide independence**.

---

## 3. Levels of Data Abstraction

The **ANSI/SPARC architecture** defines **3 levels**:

### 1. **Internal Level (Physical Level)**

* Describes **how data is physically stored** inside the system.
* Deals with **storage blocks, indexes, B-trees, hashing, compression**.
* Example (CodingGita): Student data stored as binary files on SSD, organized in B+ tree indexes.
* **Users:** Database Administrators (DBAs).

---

### 2. **Conceptual Level (Logical Level)**

* Describes **what data is stored in the database** and the **relationships** among data.
* Independent of physical storage.
* Example (CodingGita):

  * Student(RollNo, Name, Phone, CourseID)
  * Course(CourseID, Title, FacultyID)
  * Faculty(FacultyID, Name, Dept)
* Defines **schemas, tables, constraints, relationships**.
* **Users:** Database Designers, Developers.

---

### 3. **External Level (View Level)**

* The **highest level of abstraction** ‚Üí what end users actually see.
* Multiple external views can be created for different users.
* Example (CodingGita):

  * **Student View:** Shows only RollNo, Name, Marks.
  * **Faculty View:** Shows Students + Marks of their subject.
  * **Admin View:** Shows everything (fees, attendance, results).
* **Users:** End Users.

```
+-------------------------------+
|  External Level (View Level)  |
|  - Students see only their    |
|    marks                      |
|  - Teachers see subject marks |
|  - Admin sees all data        |
+-------------------------------+
               |
               v
+-------------------------------+
|  Conceptual Level (Logical)   |
|  - Defines tables, schemas,   |
|    relationships              |
|  - e.g., Student, Course,     |
|    Faculty tables             |
+-------------------------------+
               |
               v
+-------------------------------+
|  Internal Level (Physical)    |
|  - Data stored on disk using  |
|    files, indexes, B+ trees   |
+-------------------------------+
```

## 5. Importance of 3-Level Architecture

1. **Security**

   * Students cannot access fee records.
   * Faculty cannot see data of other departments.

2. **Data Independence**

   * Physical storage can change (new indexing method) without affecting user views.
   * Logical schema can evolve (add new attributes) without affecting applications.

3. **Simplification for Users**

   * End users only see **relevant data**, not the complexity behind it.

4. **Multiple Views**

   * A single database supports multiple external views for different roles.

---

## 6. Example ‚Äì CodingGita Student Database (Multi-View Case)

Imagine **CodingGita Database** with 3 tables:

* **Student**(RollNo, Name, Phone, CourseID, FeeStatus)
* **Course**(CourseID, Title, FacultyID)
* **Marks**(RollNo, CourseID, Marks)

### Views:

* **Student User:**

  ```
  RollNo | Name   | CourseID | Marks
  ```
* **Faculty User:**

  ```
  FacultyID | CourseID | StudentName | Marks
  ```
* **Admin User:**

  ```
  RollNo | Name | Phone | CourseID | FeeStatus | Marks
  ```

üëâ Same database, but each role sees **different views**.

---

## 7. Summary

* The **View of Data** in DBMS is divided into **3 levels**:

  * **Internal Level** ‚Üí How data is physically stored.
  * **Conceptual Level** ‚Üí What data and relationships exist.
  * **External Level** ‚Üí How users see the data.
* Purpose: To provide **data abstraction, security, and independence**.
* Real-world example: CodingGita ‚Üí Students, Faculty, Admin all view the same central data differently.
