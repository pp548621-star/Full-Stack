# Data Models in DBMS

## 1. Introduction

A **Data Model** defines **how data is represented, organized, and related** in a database system.
It acts as a **blueprint** that guides how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated.

ðŸ‘‰ Example: At CodingGita, we need to model:

* Students, Courses, Faculty, Marks, Fees.

Depending on the chosen **data model**, this information can be stored in **different structures** (tables, trees, graphs).

---

## 2. Types of Data Models

DBMS supports multiple **data models**, but in Unit 1, we focus on **Hierarchical, Network, and Relational Models**.

---

## 3. Hierarchical Data Model

### Definition

* Organizes data into a **tree-like structure**.
* Each **parent node** can have multiple **child nodes**, but each child has **only one parent**.
* Best for **one-to-many relationships**.

### Example â€“ CodingGita Course Structure

```
University
   â”œâ”€â”€ Faculty of Engineering
   â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ Department of CS
   â”‚     â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ Course: DBMS
   â”‚     â”‚     â””â”€â”€ Course: DSA
   â”‚     â””â”€â”€ Department of ECE
   â”‚           â””â”€â”€ Course: Circuits
   â””â”€â”€ Faculty of Management
         â””â”€â”€ Course: MBA
```

### Features

* Fast access if hierarchy matches real world.
* Good for static data.

### Limitations

* Cannot model **many-to-many relationships** easily.
* Rigid structure (difficult to modify).

### Real-World Use

* Used in **early banking and airline reservation systems**.
* Example software: **IBM IMS (Information Management System)**.

---

## 4. Network Data Model

### Definition

* Organizes data as a **graph** (nodes and edges).
* A child can have **multiple parents**.
* Supports **many-to-many relationships**.

### Example â€“ CodingGita Student-Course Enrollment

```
[Student] <---enrolled_in---> [Course]
```

* One **student** can enroll in multiple courses.
* One **course** can have multiple students.

This is modeled using **pointers** in Network DB.

### Features

* More flexible than Hierarchical DB.
* Supports complex relationships.

### Limitations

* Hard to design and maintain.
* Requires navigational access (must follow pointers).

### Real-World Use

* **Telecom networks, supply chain management**.
* Example: **Integrated Data Store (IDS)**.

---

## 5. Relational Data Model (Most Common Today)

### Definition

* Data is stored in **tables (relations)** with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).
* Relationships are represented using **keys (primary, foreign)**.
* Introduced by **E. F. Codd** in 1970.

### Example â€“ CodingGita Student Database

**Student Table**

| RollNo | Name  | CourseID | FeeStatus |
| ------ | ----- | -------- | --------- |
| 101    | Jenil | CS101    | Paid      |
| 102    | Mahir | CS102    | Pending   |
| 103    | Arjun | CS101    | Paid      |

**Course Table**

| CourseID | Title | FacultyID |
| -------- | ----- | --------- |
| CS101    | DBMS  | F001      |
| CS102    | DSA   | F002      |

**Faculty Table**

| FacultyID | Name    | Dept |
| --------- | ------- | ---- |
| F001      | Yashvi  | CS   |
| F002      | Krishna | CS   |

ðŸ‘‰ Relationships:

* Student.CourseID â†’ Course.CourseID
* Course.FacultyID â†’ Faculty.FacultyID

### Features

* Based on **mathematical relations**.
* Uses **SQL** as query language.
* Enforces **ACID properties**.
* Data is easy to retrieve and update.

### Limitations

* Not ideal for unstructured/big data.
* Needs normalization to avoid redundancy.

### Real-World Use

* **MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server** (most used DBMS today).

## 6. Comparison of Models

| Feature            | Hierarchical Model  | Network Model         | Relational Model                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Structure**      | Tree (Parent-Child) | Graph (Nodes-Edges)   | Tables (Rows-Cols)                    |
| **Relationships**  | One-to-Many         | Many-to-Many          | One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many |
| **Flexibility**    | Low                 | Medium                | High                                  |
| **Query Language** | Navigational        | Navigational          | SQL (Declarative)                     |
| **Ease of Use**    | Hard to modify      | Complex pointers      | Simple & widely used                  |
| **Real Use**       | Old banking, IMS    | Telecom, supply chain | Education, e-commerce, apps           |

## 7. Diagram (Textual Representation)

### Hierarchical

```
University
  â””â”€â”€ Faculty
        â””â”€â”€ Department
              â””â”€â”€ Course
```

### Network

```
Student  <---enrolled_in---> Course
```

### Relational

```
Student Table <--(CourseID)-- Course Table <--(FacultyID)-- Faculty Table
```

## 8. Which Model is Best ?

* **Hierarchical Model** â†’ Could model course catalog (but too rigid).
* **Network Model** â†’ Could model student-course enrollment (but too complex).
* **Relational Model** â†’ Best choice â†’ simple tables, easy relationships, SQL support.

ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s why most modern apps use **Relational Databases** like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

---

## 9. Summary

* A **Data Model** defines how data is structured in a database.
* **Hierarchical Model:** Tree-like, simple but rigid.
* **Network Model:** Graph-like, supports many-to-many but complex.
* **Relational Model:** Table-based, simple, most popular today.
* **CodingGita Example:**

  * Hierarchical â†’ Course catalog.
  * Network â†’ Student-Course relationships.
  * Relational â†’ Student-Teacher-Course DB (real implementation).
