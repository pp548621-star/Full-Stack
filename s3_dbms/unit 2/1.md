# Relational Model (Domains, Relations, Relational Algebra, Tuple Calculus)


## 1. Introduction

The **Relational Model** is the **most widely used model** in database systems today.
Proposed by **E. F. Codd in 1970**, it represents data in the form of **tables (relations)**.

👉 Why important?

* Simple to understand (rows & columns).
* Powerful query language (**SQL**) supports it.
* Used in **almost every enterprise system** (CodingGita portal, banks, e-commerce).

---

## 2. Structure of Relational Databases

A **Relation = Table**

* **Rows (Tuples):** Each row represents one record.
* **Columns (Attributes):** Each column represents one property of the entity.
* **Domain:** The set of allowed values for an attribute.

### Example 1 – CodingGita Student Table

| RollNo | Name   | CourseID | Semester | City      | Marks |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | -------- | --------- | ----- |
| 101    | Jenil  | CS101    | 3        | Ahmedabad | 85    |
| 102    | Mahir  | CS102    | 3        | Surat     | 76    |
| 103    | Arjun  | CS101    | 3        | Vadodara  | 92    |
| 104    | Yashvi | CS103    | 3        | Rajkot    | 81    |

* **Attributes:** RollNo, Name, CourseID, Semester, City, Marks.
* **Tuple:** (101, Jenil, CS101, 3, Ahmedabad, 85).
* **Domain of City:** {Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, …}.
* **Domain of Marks:** Integers between 0–100.

---

## 3. Concepts in Relational Model

### 3.1 Domains

* A **domain** is the set of valid values an attribute can take.
* Example:

  * RollNo → Positive integers (100–999).
  * Semester → {1, 2, 3, …, 8}.
  * City → Names of Indian cities.

👉 Domains ensure **data integrity**.

---

### 3.2 Relations

* A **relation** is a table with unique rows (tuples).
* Order of tuples does not matter.
* Each attribute must come from a domain.

Example – CodingGita **Course Table**:

| CourseID | Title | FacultyID | Department |
| -------- | ----- | --------- | ---------- |
| CS101    | DBMS  | F001      | CSE        |
| CS102    | DSA   | F002      | CSE        |
| CS103    | OS    | F003      | IT         |

---

### 3.3 Keys

Keys are **unique identifiers** for tuples.

* **Primary Key:** Unique identifier for a table.

  * Student.RollNo, Course.CourseID.
* **Candidate Key:** All possible unique identifiers.

  * Student → {RollNo}, {Name + CourseID}.
* **Foreign Key:** Attribute in one table referring to primary key of another.

  * Student.CourseID → Course.CourseID.

👉 Example: If Mahir is enrolled in CS102, Student table’s CourseID = CS102 links to Course table.

## 4. Relational Algebra

Relational Algebra is a **mathematical query language** for relational databases.
It defines operations that take one or two relations as input and produce another relation as output.

### 4.1 Basic Operators

1. **Selection (σ)** → Select rows.

   * Example: Get all students from Ahmedabad.
   * σ City="Ahmedabad" (Student)
   * Result: Jenil.

2. **Projection (π)** → Select columns.

   * Example: Get only names of students.
   * π Name (Student) → {Jenil, Mahir, Arjun, Yashvi}.

3. **Union (∪)** → Combine tuples from two relations.

   * Example: List of students in DBMS ∪ students in DSA.

4. **Set Difference (−)** → Tuples in one relation but not another.

   * Example: Students in DBMS − students in DSA.

5. **Cartesian Product (×)** → All combinations of tuples.

   * Example: Student × Course → every student with every course (used in joins).

6. **Rename (ρ)** → Rename relation or attribute.

---

### 4.2 Advanced Operators

1. **Join (⨝)**

   * Combines related tuples from two relations.
   * Example: Get student names with course titles.
   * Student ⨝ Student.CourseID=Course.CourseID Course.

   Result:

   ```
   Jenil → DBMS
   Mahir → DSA
   Arjun → DBMS
   Yashvi → OS
   ```

2. **Intersection (∩)**

   * Students common in both DBMS and DSA.

3. **Division (÷)**

   * Find students enrolled in **all courses** taught by FacultyID F001.

---

### Example 2 – Real Query Simulation

If we want **all students enrolled in CS101 (DBMS)**:

* Relational Algebra:
  σ CourseID=CS101 (Student)
* Result: Jenil, Arjun.

---

## 5. Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC)

Unlike relational algebra (procedural), **TRC is declarative**.
We just specify **what we want**, not how to compute it.

### Syntax

{ t | Condition(t) }
Where `t` is a tuple variable.

### Example 1

Find students from Rajkot.
TRC:

```
{ t.Name | Student(t) ∧ t.City = "Rajkot" }
```

### Example 2

Find students enrolled in CS101.

```
{ t.Name | Student(t) ∧ t.CourseID = "CS101" }
```

### Example 3

Find names of students with marks > 80.

```
{ t.Name | Student(t) ∧ t.Marks > 80 }
```

---

## 6. Multiple Examples for Practice

### Example Set 1 – Student Database (CodingGita)

1. Find names of students who scored above 80.

   * Relational Algebra: σ Marks > 80 (Student).

2. Find roll numbers of students from Surat.

   * TRC: { t.RollNo | Student(t) ∧ t.City = "Surat" }.

3. Get student names and course titles.

   * Student ⨝ Course.

---

### Example Set 2 – Library Database

* **Book(BookID, Title, AuthorID)**
* **Author(AuthorID, Name)**
* **Issue(BookID, RollNo, Date)**

Queries:

1. Get names of all authors whose books are issued.
2. Get titles of books issued by student 101.
3. Find students who issued more than 3 books.

---

### Example Set 3 – Banking Database

* **Customer(CustID, Name, AccountID)**
* **Account(AccountID, Balance, City)**

Queries:

1. Get customers with balance > ₹50,000.
2. Find customers living in Ahmedabad.
3. Get all accounts not linked to any customer.

---

## 7. Summary

* **Relational Model** stores data in **tables (relations)**.
* **Domains** define allowed values for attributes.
* **Keys** (Primary, Candidate, Foreign) ensure uniqueness and relationships.
* **Relational Algebra** = Procedural query language (Selection, Projection, Join, etc.).
* **Tuple Relational Calculus** = Declarative query language (specify what, not how).
* CodingGita examples (students, courses, cities, semesters) show how relational model works in real life.
