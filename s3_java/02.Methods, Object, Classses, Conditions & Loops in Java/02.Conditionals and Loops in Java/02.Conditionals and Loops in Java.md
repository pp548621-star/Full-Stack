# Conditionals Statement and Loops in Java:
# Conditionals Statement in Java

## What are Conditionals Statement?

Conditionals in Java are programming constructs that allow execution of code blocks based on **boolean expressions**—true or false outcomes. They enable *decision-making* in programs, where different paths can be taken depending on data or program state.

***

## Why Use Conditionals Statement?

- To control program flow dynamically based on conditions.
- To implement logic branching and decision trees.
- To execute specific code sections selectively.
- To handle multiple scenarios cleanly and maintainably.

***

## Types of Conditionals Statement in Java

- **if** statement
- **if-else** statement
- **if-else-if ladder**
- **switch** statement

***

## 1. The `if` Statement


***

### What is it?

The `if` statement in Java allows a program to execute a block of code **only when a specified condition evaluates to true**. If the condition is false, the block is skipped entirely. This fundamental conditional branching lets programs make real-time decisions and alter their execution path dynamically based on boolean expressions. It is the simplest form of decision making in Java and forms the backbone of many complex control flows in applications.

***

### Why use it?

Using the `if` statement is crucial for scenarios where you need to perform an action **only under specific circumstances**. For example, checking if a user meets eligibility criteria, validating input, or enforcing constraints. This ensures that certain code executes selectively, improving program efficiency and logic clarity.

***

### Example and Explanation

```java
int age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("You are eligible to vote.");
}
```

This example determines if a person is eligible to vote based on their age. Here, the condition `age >= 18` is evaluated.

***

### Step-by-Step Execution Visual

| Step | Operation | Explanation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Evaluate condition: `age >= 18` | Since `18 >= 18` is `true`, proceed. |
| 2 | Execute block inside `if` | Prints: *"You are eligible to vote."* |
| 3 | Exit `if` | Program continues after the block. |


***

### Visual Representation

```
Condition: age >= 18 → true
+---------------------------+
| Execute inside if block    |
| Output: "You are eligible" |
+---------------------------+
```


***

## 2. The `if-else` Statement


***

### What is it?

The `if-else` statement provides two distinct paths of execution: it **executes one block if the condition is true and another if it is false**. This binary branching is used for making clear choices between two mutually exclusive options.

***

### Why use it?

`if-else` is essential when you want your program to react differently based on a yes/no or true/false condition. This allows handling of alternate processing or behaviors without redundant or complex code. For example, identifying whether a number is even or odd and acting accordingly.

***

### Example and Explanation

```java
int number = 5;

if (number % 2 == 0) {
    System.out.println("Even number");
} else {
    System.out.println("Odd number");
}
```

The code checks whether `number` is even or odd by testing the modulus with 2.

***

### Step-by-Step Execution Visual

| Step | Operation | Explanation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Evaluate condition: `number % 2 == 0` | `5 % 2 = 1` → condition `false`. |
| 2 | Since false, execute `else` block | Prints: *"Odd number".* |
| 3 | Continue program after else block | No further branches checked. |


***

### Visual Representation

```
Condition: 5 % 2 == 0 → false
        +----------------+    +-----------------+
        | if block (no)  |    | else block (yes)|
        +----------------+    +-----------------+
                  Output: "Odd number"
```


***

## 3. The `if-else-if` Ladder


***

### What is it?

The `if-else-if` ladder chains multiple conditions sequentially. The program evaluates each condition from top to bottom and executes the block of the **first condition that evaluates to true**, skipping the rest. If no conditions are true, the optional final `else` block executes.

***

### Why use it?

When multiple **mutually exclusive** scenarios need checking, the `if-else-if` ladder provides a clean, readable way to handle many cases without deeply nested statements. It's commonly used for grading systems, menu selections, or categorization.

***

### Example and Explanation

```java
int marks = 75;

if (marks >= 90) {
    System.out.println("Grade A");
} else if (marks >= 75) {
    System.out.println("Grade B");
} else if (marks >= 50) {
    System.out.println("Grade C");
} else {
    System.out.println("Fail");
}
```

This evaluates exam marks and prints the corresponding grade.

***

### Step-by-Step Execution Visual

| Step | Operation | Explanation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Check `marks >= 90` | 75 >= 90 → `false` |
| 2 | Move to next condition |  |
| 3 | Check `marks >= 75` | 75 >= 75 → `true` |
| 4 | Execute grade B block | Prints: *"Grade B"* |
| 5 | Exit ladder | No further conditions checked. |


***

### Visual Representation

```
marks = 75
+-----------------+    +------------------+    +-------------------+    +------------+
| marks >= 90 ? F | -> | marks >= 75 ? T  | -> | Execute "Grade B"  | -> | Exit ladder |
+-----------------+    +------------------+    +-------------------+    +------------+
```


***

## 4. The `switch` Statement


***

### What is it?

The `switch` statement evaluates an expression and **selects a matching case block** to execute. It is an alternative to long `if-else-if` chains when there are multiple discrete cases based on the value of a variable.

***

### Why use it?

`switch` enhances code clarity when dealing with fixed set of possible values (e.g., menu choices, days of the week) and often improves efficiency.

***

### Example and Explanation

```java
int day = 3;
switch(day) {
    case 1: System.out.println("Monday"); break;
    case 2: System.out.println("Tuesday"); break;
    case 3: System.out.println("Wednesday"); break;
    default: System.out.println("Invalid day"); break;
}
```

This prints the name of the day based on an integer.

***

### Step-by-Step Execution Visual

| Step | Operation | Explanation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Evaluate `day` | `day = 3` |
| 2 | Match `case 3` | Executes `System.out.println("Wednesday")` |
| 3 | Encounter `break` | Exits the switch, no further cases checked |


***

### Visual Representation

```
switch(day=3)
+--------+        +-----------------+
| case 1 |------->| Ignore          |
+--------+        +-----------------+
| case 2 |------->| Ignore          |
+--------+        +-----------------+
| case 3 |------->| Execute "Wednesday"
+--------+        +-----------------+
| default|------->| Skip due to break
+--------+
```

# Loops in Java:


***

## What are Loops?

Loops are control flow structures that **repeat a block of code either as long as a condition is true or for a fixed number of iterations**. Java provides multiple types of loops to handle different scenarios efficiently and cleanly:

- **for**
- **while**
- **do-while**
- **for-each**

Loops are fundamental in programming for automating repetitive tasks, enabling iteration over data structures, and implementing algorithms involving repeated processing.

***

## Why Use Loops?

- Automate repetitive and tedious tasks.
- Iterate easily over arrays, collections, or ranges.
- Reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.
- Manage complex workflows involving repeated checks or operations.
- Allow dynamic termination conditions.

***

## 1. The `for` Loop


***

### What is it?

The `for` loop provides a compact way to repeat a block of code a **fixed or known number of times**. It includes initialization, condition checking, and update expressions all in one line, making it well-suited for deterministic iterations.

***

### Why use it?

Best when the number of iterations is known or can be calculated upfront. For example, processing all elements in an array or running a fixed number of trials in a simulation.

***

### Example and Explanation

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Count: " + i);
}
```


***

### Step-by-Step Execution Visual

| Iteration (i) | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Condition | true (0 < 5) | true (1 < 5) | true (2 < 5) | true (3 < 5) | true (4 < 5) |
| Action | Print 0 | Print 1 | Print 2 | Print 3 | Print 4 |
| Increment i | i = 1 | i = 2 | i = 3 | i = 4 | i = 5 |

Loop stops when `i=5` as `5 < 5` is false.

***

### Visual Representation

```
for (i=0; i<5; i++) {
    // loop body
}
+-----+   +-----+   +-----+   +-----+   +-----+
| i=0 |→ | print|→ | i=1 |→ | print|→ | ... |
+-----+   +-----+   +-----+   +-----+   +-----+

Condition is checked at the start of each iteration.
```


***

## 2. The `while` Loop


***

### What is it?

The `while` loop repeats a block of code **as long as the condition remains true**. It checks the condition before each iteration, making it useful when the number of iterations depends on dynamic runtime conditions.

***

### Why use it?

Ideal when the iteration count is unknown upfront and depends on dynamic checks like user input, file reading, or asynchronous events.

***

### Example and Explanation

```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 3) {
    System.out.println("i: " + i);
    i++;
}
```


***

### Step-by-Step Execution Visual

| Iteration (i) | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Condition | true (0 < 3) | true (1 < 3) | true (2 < 3) |
| Action | Print 0 | Print 1 | Print 2 |
| Increment i | i = 1 | i = 2 | i = 3 |

Loop terminates when `i=3`, as `3<3` is false.

***

### Visual Representation

```
Initialize i=0
+--------+    +--------------+
| Check  |->  | i < 3 true?  |
+--------+    +--------------+
      ↓             ↓
   Execute        Exit loop
    body, then
 increment i
```


***

## 3. The `do-while` Loop


***

### What is it?

The `do-while` loop is similar to `while` but **executes the block first, then checks the condition**, guaranteeing at least one execution.

***

### Why use it?

Used when the loop body must run at least once, such as prompting user input before validating.

***

### Example and Explanation

```java
int i = 0;
do {
    System.out.println("i: " + i);
    i++;
} while (i < 3);
```


***

### Step-by-Step Execution Visual

| Iteration (i) | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Action | Print 0 | Print 1 | Print 2 |
| Increment i | i=1 | i=2 | i=3 |
| Condition | true (0<3) | true (1<3) | true (2<3) |

The loop stops after the condition becomes false (`i=3`).

***

### Visual Representation

```
do {
   // execute block
} while(condition);

Flow:
Execute block → Check condition → Repeat if true
```


***

## 4. The `for-each` Loop


***

### What is it?

The `for-each` loop simplifies iteration over arrays or collections by automatically handling index traversal and providing direct access to each element.

***

### Why use it?

Use it for clean and concise iteration when indexes are not needed.

***

### Example and Explanation

```java
int[] numbers = {5, 10, 15};
for (int num : numbers) {
    System.out.println(num);
}
```


***

### Step-by-Step Execution Visual

| Iteration | 1st | 2nd | 3rd |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| num | 5 | 10 | 15 |
| Action | Print 5 | Print 10 | Print 15 |


***

### Visual Representation

```
Array: [5, 10, 15]
Loop execution:
num = 5 → print → num = 10 → print → num = 15 → print
```
