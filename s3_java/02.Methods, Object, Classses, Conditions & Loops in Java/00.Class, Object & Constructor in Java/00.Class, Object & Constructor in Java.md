# What is OOPs in Java?

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm centered around objects rather than actions or logic. Java, being an object-oriented language, models software entities as **objects** that encapsulate data and behaviors, mirroring real-world things and interactions.

***

## Core Concepts of OOP in Java

- **Encapsulation:** Groups data (fields) and methods into one unit (class) and hides internal details from outside.
- **Inheritance:** Allows one class (child) to acquire the properties and methods of another (parent), fostering code reuse.
- **Polymorphism:** Enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class, allowing multiple behaviors with a single interface.
- **Abstraction:** Exposes only essential features while hiding complex implementation.

***

# Class in Java

## What is a Class?

A **class** is a blueprint for objects. It defines the **attributes** (variables) and **behaviors** (methods) of the objects created from it.

***

## Why Use Classes?

- To define entities with common structure and functionality.
- To enable creation of multiple distinct objects following the same blueprint.
- To organize code into modular, manageable units.

***

## Class Example:

```java
public class Car {
    // Fields (Attributes)
    String color;
    String model;

    // Method (Behavior)
    void start() {
        System.out.println("The car has started.");
    }
}
```


***

## Visual Representation of the Class

| Class Name | Car |
| :-- | :-- |
| Attributes | color : String |
|  | model : String |
| Methods | start() : void |


***

## Backend Memory Representation: Class Metadata in Method Area

```
+-----------------------------------------------+
|               Method Area (Heap)               |
|   +---------------------------------------+    |
|   | Car Class Metadata                     |   |
|   | - Field definitions: color, model      |   |
|   | - Method definitions: start()          |   |
|   +---------------------------------------+    |
+-----------------------------------------------+
```

- The class metadata is loaded once per class by class loader.
- It describes the structure and behavior for any Car object.

***

# Object in Java

## What is an Object?

An **object** is an instance of a class. It has its own copy of attributes and can invoke class methods.

***

## Why Use Objects?

- To model real-world entities with state and behavior.
- To manage multiple unique instances based on the same class.
- To encapsulate data and provide interaction interfaces.

***

## Object Creation Example:

```java
Car myCar = new Car();  
myCar.color = "Red";
myCar.model = "Sedan";
myCar.start();  // Output: The car has started.
```


***

## Visual Representation of the Object

| Object | myCar |
| :-- | :-- |
| Class | Car |
| color | "Red" |
| model | "Sedan" |


***

## Backend Visual Representation: Object Instance in Heap and Reference in Stack

When `Car myCar = new Car();` executes:

```
Stack Frame (method main):
+------------------------+
| myCar (reference) ---->+-----------------+
+------------------------+                 |
                                           |  Heap Memory
                                           |
                                           v
                                  +-----------------------+
                                  | Car Object in Heap    |
                                  |-----------------------|
                                  | color: null           |
                                  | model: null           |
                                  +-----------------------+
```

- The reference variable `myCar` is stored on the **stack**.
- The actual object resides in the **heap**, initially with default `null` attributes.

***

# Constructor in Java

## What is a Constructor?

A **constructor** is a special method for initializing new objects. It shares the class name and has no return type.

***

## Why Use Constructors?

- To initialize object attributes upon creation.
- To enforce object correctness from the start.
- To simplify object instantiation with meaningful initial data.

***

## Types of Constructors

- **Default Constructor:** Provided automatically if none is defined; initializes with default values.
- **Parameterized Constructor:** Takes parameters to initialize objects with specific values.

***

## Constructor Example

```java
public class Car {
    String color;
    String model;

    // Parameterized Constructor
    public Car(String color, String model) {
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
    }

    void start() {
        System.out.println("The car has started.");
    }
}
```

Object Creation:

```java
Car myCar = new Car("Blue", "SUV");
myCar.start();  // Output: The car has started.
```


***

## Step-by-Step Visual Representation of Constructor Use

| Step | Action | Explanation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | `new Car("Blue", "SUV")` invoked | Allocate memory for new object on heap |
| 2 | Constructor runs | Assigns `"Blue"` to `color` field |
| 3 | Constructor runs | Assigns `"SUV"` to `model` field |
| 4 | Object initialized | `myCar.color == "Blue"`, `myCar.model == "SUV"` |
| 5 | `myCar.start()` method called | Executes behavior defined in the Car class |


***

# Backend Visual Representation: Object Creation in Heap and Stack

When `Car myCar = new Car("Blue", "SUV");` executes:

```
Stack Frame (method main):
+------------------------+
| myCar (reference) ---->+-----------------+
+------------------------+                 |
                                           |  Heap Memory
                                           |
                                           v
                                  +-----------------------+
                                  | Car Object in Heap    |
                                  |-----------------------|
                                  | color: "Blue"         |
                                  | model: "SUV"          |
                                  +-----------------------+
```

- The **reference variable** `myCar` is stored on the **stack**.
- The actual **object instance** resides in the **heap**, with fields storing `"Blue"` and `"SUV"`.

***

## Detailed Stepwise Workflow in Memory:

| Step | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1 | JVM allocates space on heap for the `Car` object. |
| 2 | Fields `color` and `model` memory created inside the object. |
| 3 | Parameters `"Blue"` and `"SUV"` assigned to respective fields during constructor execution. |
| 4 | Reference `myCar` stored on the stack points to heap object. |
| 5 | Calling `myCar.start()` uses the stack frame to access method and object fields. |

# Summary Table: Class, Object, Constructor \& Memory

| Concept | Description | Memory Area | Purpose |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Class** | Blueprint for objects | Method area (Class metadata) | Defines structure \& behavior |
| **Object** | Instance with attributes \& methods | Heap | Represents real-world entities |
| **Constructor** | Special method to initialize objects | Executed on stack calling heap | Sets initial object state |
| **Reference** | Variable holding address of an object | Stack | Points to heap object |


***

# Additional Notes:

- OOP’s **encapsulation** is enforced via access modifiers (`private`, `public`).
- Objects interact via **methods**, allowing abstraction and modularity.
- Constructors can be **overloaded** to provide multiple ways to instantiate.
- Java’s **garbage collector** automatically manages memory freeing when objects are no longer referenced.
